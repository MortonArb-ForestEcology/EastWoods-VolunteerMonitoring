# Description: Stratified random sampling plot selection design to ensure that we get data from all major management units each year with 5-year return interval.


# File paths -- using what we've already done for ease right now

path.ew <- "../../EastWoods-MonitoringPlots/plot_selection/" # This is a different github repository
