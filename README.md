## Background:
Building off of the two past surveys (2007, 2018) performed by IES as part of a (Bell Labs??) grant at the IMLS plots scattered throughout the East Woods.  The two surveys provided detailed data across the East Woods, but the time period in between has made it hard to detect management-linked patterns of change.  In regular discussions in 2021 and 2022, a team of Arboretum Natural Resources staff (Driesilker, Campbell) and scientists (Rollinson, Midgley) agreed to shift to a rotating monitoring scheme loosely based off of the US Forest Service Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) plan wherein a different set of plots are monitored each year so that every plot is revisited every 5 or so years.  The plots to be monitored each year will be selected using a stratified random sampling to ensure that we will receive data from all major management units each year.
